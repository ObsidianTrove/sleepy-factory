Alembic migrations live in this directory.

- env.py configures Alembic to read DATABASE_URL from the project settings (.env).
- versions/ contains migration history and should be committed.

Generate a new migration:
  uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe change"

Apply migrations:
  uv run alembic upgrade head
